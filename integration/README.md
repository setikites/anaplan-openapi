# Anaplan Integration API

## Sources

| Source | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Apiary docs | https://anaplan.docs.apiary.io/ (identifier: `anaplan`) |
| Postman collection | `Official Anaplan Collection.postman_collection.json` (repo root and `integration/`) |
| Extracted schemas | `integration/objectSchema.json`, `integration/modelObjectschema.json` |
| OpenAPI spec | `integration/integration-openapi.json` |

## Authentication

The Integration API supports two authentication schemes:

1. **Bearer Token** (standard, RFC 6750)
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
   ```
   Obtain an access token from the OAuth API (`oauth/oauth-openapi.json`).

2. **AnaplanAuthToken** (proprietary)
   ```
   Authorization: AnaplanAuthToken <token>
   ```
   Obtain a token from the Authentication API (`authentication/authentication-openapi.json`).

Both schemes are declared in `securitySchemes` and applied globally. Individual endpoints may restrict which scheme is accepted.

## Regional Server URLs

The Integration API uses `api.anaplan.com` endpoints. Legacy regions (US1, US2, US5, US7, EU1, EU2, EU4, AP1) share the unqualified `api.anaplan.com` base URL. Newer cloud regions have region-prefixed URLs (e.g., `us9.api.anaplan.com`). See the `servers[]` array in the spec for the full list.

## Extracted Schema Files

- **`objectSchema.json`** — Schema extracted from live `/objects/` API response. Documents the structure of Anaplan model objects.
- **`modelObjectschema.json`** — Schema extracted from live model object API response. Used to validate model-level object payloads.

These files were extracted from a live Anaplan instance and represent actual API response shapes.
